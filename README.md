Overwatch
=========

<b>UPDATE NOTE:</b>

Big changes are coming to Overwatch in the near future. For the past two years, development has been frozen and the project shelved due to a certain uncooperative member of the FAU engineering department faculty. While case research was thorough and my designs universally accepted among the different user groups, some people would rather an ineffective (and generally circumvented) system that grants them greater political power over areas where they have no authority.

I have long since left FAU, following my graduation in Spring 2015, and have determined that my own personal lab would benefit from an inventory control system. While my needs are much less specific than those of the people I interviewed, and I have no use for real inventory tracking, I still need the core functionality. This gives me the motivation I needed to finally resume development on Overwatch. Once I have made more progress on the web UI and API, I will update the repository and rewrite the philosophy, goals, and roadmap.
